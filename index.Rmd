title: "Utilization Analysis of Online New Staff Orientation Program"
---

The Perelman School of Medicine (PSOM) at the University of Pennsylvania offers an orientation program for its University employees who are working within PSOM for the first time. This program is designated for staff only (vs. faculty) and is supplemental to the New Staff Orientation Program provided by the University to all new staff employees. PSOM processes approximately 900 new hires each year.

In November of 2018, a revised orientation program delivered completely as an online experience was launched as a replacement for the previous instructor-led program that was offered on a bi-monthly basis. The primary objectives of the program redesign were to 1) provide the orientation experience as close as possible to the employment start date, 2) increase the total proportion of new staff hires completing PSOM orientation, and 3) reduce the direct cost and administrative effort associated with the old program. To date, over 700 individuals have qualified to enroll in the new program as a new staff hire.

## Research Question


## Theoretical Motivation

This project is an opportunity to perform statistical analyses that provide insight into the characteristic profile of the proportion of individuals who have completed the orientation, as well as the proportion that did not, to inform future program revisions that result in a 95% overall program completion rate within three weeks of the employment start date.
